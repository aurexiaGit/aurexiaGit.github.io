## How to modify the codes

GitHub is the best way to develop your programs. Indeed, it allows several users to access the same code, 
modify it on their computer and commit it back on the GitHub. All the different commits are available
which allows you to go back to a previous version whenever it suits you.

In order to interact with the GitHub server and change the files, you can simply change them on this page. 
However, the best practice is to download the files onto your computer and modify the files directly onto your computer.
Once you are done modifying the files, do as follows:

1. Open command window into the project's folder
2. Enter "git add ."
3. Enter "git commit -m "TITLE OF YOUR COMMIT"
4. Enter "git push"

If the codes were modified by some other user implying that the files on your computer do not correspond with the files
on the GitHub, before modifying anything you must:

1. Open command window into the project's folder
2. Enter "git pull"
